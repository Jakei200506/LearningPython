A Tool that uses a Rotten tomatoes api to show the movies information using the "rottentomatoes-python" library. 🍅 \n
use the command "pip install rottentomatoes-python" \n
the api is very buggy, so sometimes it will fail and get the wrong movie info (i.e. input = Kung Fu Panda (it gets the fourth movie not the first one))
